Three alcid species are particularly susceptible to gillnet bycatch (common murres Uria aalge, marbled murrelets Brachyramphus marmoratus (listed as “Threatened” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act) and rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata), with estimates of mortality in commercial salmon net fisheries ranging from hundreds to thousands of individuals annually. Despite the risk posed by gillnets, the population-level impacts of mortality due to entanglement have not been estimated. Therefore, we wanted to (1) understand how varying levels of gillnet bycatch may impact population growth and persistence and (2) estimate the population size needed to withstand recent estimates of entanglement mortality …"

We propose an alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm with a suitable initialization for two widely considered permutation models: partially shuffled/k-sparse permutations and r-local/block diagonal permutations. Key to the performance of the AltMin algorithm is the initialization. For the exact unlabeled sensing problem, assuming either a Gaussian measurement matrix or a sub-Gaussian signal, we bound the initialization error in terms of the number of blocks s and the number of shuffles k. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast, applicable to both permutation models, and robust to choice of measurement matrix. We also test our algorithm on several real datasets for the ‘linked linear regression’problem and show superior performance compared to baseline methods."

Herein, we propose acoustofluidic separation of biomarker proteins from platelets in plasma using aptamer-functionalized microparticles. As model proteins, C-reactive protein and thrombin were spiked in human platelet-rich plasma. The target proteins were selectively conjugated with their corresponding aptamer-functionalized microparticles of different sizes, and the particle complexes served as a mobile carrier for the conjugated proteins. The proposed acoustofluidic device was composed of an interdigital transducer (IDT) patterned on a piezoelectric substrate and a disposable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chip. The PDMS chip was placed in a tilted arrangement with the IDT to utilize both vertical and horizontal components of surface acoustic wave-induced acoustic radiation force (ARF) for multiplexed assay at …"

However, the spatial-temporal mechanisms dictating kidney FGF23 functions remain poorly understood. Thus, developing approaches to modify specific FGF23-dictated pathways has proven problematic. Herein, wild type mice were injected with rFGF23 for one, four and 12h and kidney FGF23 bioactivity was determined at single cell resolution. Computational analysis identified distinct epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and immune cell clusters, with differential expressional analysis uniquely tracking FGF23 bioactivity at each time point. FGF23 actions were sex independent but critically relied upon constitutive KL expression mapped within proximal tubule (segments S1-S3) and distal convoluted tub/connecting tubule cell sub-populations …"

While we welcome the attention of the authors and the journal to climate justice, we find that Zimm et al. replicate a number of forms and practices of injustice and fail to recognize and include the history and breadth of environmental and climate justice scholarship. In other words, the paradox of the paper by Zimm et al. is that it unwittingly contributes to the very problem it wants to address."

The Persistent Treatment Effects of Willingness-to-Pay Experiments,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=x0r-SkQAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=x0r-SkQAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC,"Willingness-to-pay (WTP) experiments have been widely used to assess demand for a variety of products. Do they also generate persistent treatment effects? We answer this question using a randomized controlled trial of a baseline WTP experiment, combined with in-person and phone survey data over a four-year period. We find that a simple experiment leads to positive and persistent effects on adoption and usage of an improved storage technology, as well as disadoption of traditional technologies. These results are primarily driven by households who experienced the product, rather than information or salience. Failing to account for demand elicitation experiments conducted at baseline may affect the external validity of the broader experiments in which they are embedded."
